# The Fynnx | Engineering First.

> **"We don't chase trends. We engineer what survives them."**

The Fynnx is a premium software engineering agency website designed to convey authority, rigor, and technical excellence. This project features a high-performance, visually striking UI built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**.

## 🌟 Key Features & Visuals

This project implements several custom, high-end UI patterns:

*   **⚡ The Energy Surge Hero:** A massive "BUILT TO LAST" headline with a custom neon-mask animation that surges with energy.
*   **🧩 The Periodic Table of Tech:** A scientific, grid-based visualization of the tech stack (React, AWS, Docker, etc.) where each tool is treated as a fundamental element.
*   **🛡️ The Self-Healing Grid:** A canvas-based simulation in the "Credibility" section that autonomously detects "red" nodes (bugs) and heals them with a pulse of energy, visualizing reliability.
*   **📑 The Sticky Stack:** A problem/liability section where cards stack on top of each other as you scroll, emphasizing the accumulation of technical debt.
*   **📍 The Process Pipeline:** An animated timeline in the "Approach" section that fills up with light as you scroll, connecting the methodology steps.
*   **📜 The Technical Manifesto:** A sticky-scroll philosophy page where abstract technical diagrams visualize core engineering principles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** React 18 + TypeScript
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Animation:** Framer Motion + Canvas API
